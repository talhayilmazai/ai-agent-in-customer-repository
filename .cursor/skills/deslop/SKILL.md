description: Scans code to remove AI-generated clutter, unnecessary defensive checks, and verbose comments to strictly follow project coding standards.

## 🎯 Goal
Review the current code or git diff to identify and remove "AI Slop"—unnecessary verbosity, defensive coding, and redundant comments often generated by LLMs.
The goal is to restore **"Human Senior Engineer" quality**: concise, fail-fast, and idiomatic.

## Logic

Check the diff against main, and remove all AI generated slop introduced in this branch.

This includes:
- Extra comments that a human wouldn't add or is inconsistent with the rest of the file
- Extra defensive checks or try/catch blocks that are abnormal for that area of the codebase (especially if called by trusted / validated codepaths)
- Casts to any to get around type issues
- Any other style that is inconsistent with the file
- Don't put unnecessary if else checks around code that is expected to always run (e.g., reading a table that is required)

  ```python
  # Bad: checking every table name or dataframe after reading
  if self.dotcom_promotion_table_name:
      df = self.data.try_read(self.dotcom_promotion_table_name)
      if df is not None:
          # do stuff
  # Good:
  df = self.data.try_read(self.dotcom_promotion_table_name, required=True)
  # If the table name is misconfigured, let it fail loudly
  ```

- Loggings can stay unless they are excessive or redundant.
- Don't try to force yourself to remove code, if there is no slop, leave it as is.
- Verify: Ensure logic remains identical.
